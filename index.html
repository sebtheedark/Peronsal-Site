              I recently graduated from California State University, Los
              Angeles, with a degree in Computer Information Systems and a
              concentration in Information Technology. As a student I was
              exposed to various different technologies and emerging ideas, but
              I have realized that more than ever the need for web developers
              and designers is rapidly growing. I would love to use my skills
              and hone my abilities to bring positive change and impact to my
              team and others with any product that I can contribute to its
              development.

          Utilized HTML and CSS along with a Bootstrap framework to develop and
          build the core site. Implemented a navigation bar with a drop down
          menu, that when clicked, would move to the desired content on the
          site. Utilized multiple different containers to split content on
          certain parts of the site while also embedding photos and video. Added
          buttons with no current functionality, but learned how to manipulate
          and place them. Utilized HTML and JavaScript to add a modal that would
          create a feedback from to take feed back from a user.

              Led a group that was designated as the systems analysis and design
              team. The team was tasked with designing a system that would
              benefit and meet the needs of a designated company. Our team
              designed different aspects of an enterprise video conferencing
              software and how they would interact with one another, they were
              showcased via Use Cases, Domain Models, and System Sequence
              diagrams just to name a few.
