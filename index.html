              I recently graduated from California State University, Los
              Angeles, with a degree in Computer Information Systems and a
              concentration in Information Technology. As a student I was
              exposed to various different technologies and emerging ideas, but
              I have realized that more than ever the need for web developers
              and designers is rapidly growing. I would love to use my skills
              and hone my abilities to bring positive change and impact to my
              team and others with any product that I can help develop.
