              I recently graduated from California State University, Los
              Angeles, with a degree in Computer Information Systems and a
              concentration in Information Technology. As a student I was
              exposed to various different technologies and emerging ideas, but
              I have realized that more than ever the need for web developers
              and designers is rapidly growing. I would love to use my skills
              and hone my abilities to bring positive change and impact to my
              team and others with any product that I can contribute to its
              development and production.

          Utilized HTML and CSS along with a Bootstrap framework to develop and
          build the core site. Implemented a navigation bar with a drop down
          menu, that when clicked, would move to the desired content on the
          site. Utilized multiple different containers to split content on
          certain parts of the site while also embedding photos and video. Added
          buttons with no current functionality, but learned how to manipulate
          and place them. Utilized HTML and JavaScript to add a modal that would
          create a feedback from to take feed back from a user.

              Led a group that was designated as the systems analysis and design
              team. The team was tasked with designing a system that would
              benefit and meet the needs of a designated company. Our team
              designed different aspects of an enterprise video conferencing
              software and how they would interact with one another, they were
              showcased via Use Cases, Domain Models, and System Sequence
              diagrams just to name a few.

        Big Data Analysis: Used Cars for Sale

          The purpose of this project was to utilize various different
          analytical tools to be able to query data, and visualize charts on
          finding the locations that provided the most savings in terms of
          purchasing used cars. Data set was obtained from Kaggle and contained
          basic info on locations/dealers, pricing, date of upload and date of
          sale, thus showing a turnaround time for used car sales. Based on the
          prices, we were able to identify the most expensive cars and
          overpriced cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data was uploaded to a hadoop apache cluster, once uploaded, the
          data was filtered and parsed through 66 different columns with
          thousands of rows, which was then put into tables via HQL/SQL to be
          able to extract the exact data that was needed to be able to visualize
          and answer our questions.
